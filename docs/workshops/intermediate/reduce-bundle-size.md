## Introduction

Having a tool like webpack to generate code "bundles" is great to let it handle code dependencies.
However it would be quite difficult to keep those generate bundle under a critic size.

Main causes are:

- Your app contains a huge quantity of code
- You import huge dependencies
- You are generating too few bundles. Your browser need to load and parse a huge file before rendering your all app.

## Example App

:construction:

## Analysing bundle size and content

## Tree shaking your code

## Code splitting

## Lazy loading code

## Prefetching code
